# HighOrLow Card Game  

## Overview  
**HighOrLow** is an engaging card game project created with Unity. The game offers customizable gameplay features and unique enhancements that elevate player experience.

## Features  
### Customizable Card Draw Settings  
Players can define how many cards are drawn in each set, ranging from **2 to 4 cards**, offering flexibility and personalization.

### Dynamic Probability System  
A sophisticated probability system allows players to customize:  
- **Suit Weights**: Adjust the likelihood of drawing cards from specific suits.  
- **Rank Weights**: Fine-tune the probabilities of drawing specific ranks within each suit.  
Originally, Heart Suit cards were 2.3x more likely to be drawn than non-special cards, and the Ace of Spades had a 3.1x multiplier. Now, players have complete freedom to set their own weights.

### Enhanced Visuals and Audio  
- **Audio**: Background music composed by me is implemented to create an immersive atmosphere. Additional sound effects and music are sourced from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com).  
- **Images**: The project features provided card images, supplemented by carefully sourced visual elements to enrich the design.

### Settings Screen  
Before starting the game, players can access a **Settings Screen** that allows customization of the above features, creating a personalized gameplay experience.
